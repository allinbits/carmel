# Project Carmel

Draft spec, please provide feedback in the form of pull requests and issues to github.com/allinbits/carmel.

## Initial terms

 * Both parties agree on a moderator.
 * Both parties agree to keep discussions where the moderator suggests.
 * Both parties agree to mutual non-disparagement for reasonable scope.

## Step 1. Determine the topic points.

 * Both parties choose 7 key claims each to discuss.
 * If there was a court filing, the majority of key claims must be from filings.
 * The moderator must prune spurious allegations, after requesting and reviewing initial evidence.
 * The moderator can strike less than half the key points from the original 7.
 * The moderator must give good justifications for each strike.
 * The moderator can also select up to 4 additional points from filings.
 * The moderator can also add 1 point not necessarily from any filings.

## Step 2. Debate each topic point.

 * The plaintiff of each key point implicitly starts with the topic point.
 * The defendant replies, or the court filing's replies are used (if present).
 * Then plaintiff replies, then defendant replies, and so on until the moderator terminates the debate.
 * The medium of communication will be via email.
 * After termination, the moderator can make a final statement.
 * The moderator may also interject at any time.
 * Each reply is expected to take some time to complete.
 * The parties agree that the entire process will complete in 2 months.
 * The moderator can allow 1 month additional time if they find it necessary.
 * If the moderator determines that extraordinary circumstances permit, the moderator can allow additional 1 month extensions, subject to the condition that the total amount of time will not exceed 6 months

# Step 3. Sealing for privacy

 * Sealing implies authenticated encryption.
 * Once you have the sealer's key, you can decrypt the data. (encrypted)
 * Once unsealed, you know that the sealer sealed the data. (authentic)
 * Each party and the moderator propose portions of the conversation (and files) to seal, or black out, before publishing.
 * The reason for each sealing is also recorded and sealed separately.
 * The moderator decides in accordance with jurisdiction of choice.

# Step 4. Narrative Resolution

 * Both parties attempt to make a joint statement publicly.
 * Ideally both parties make concessions, but may also express dissent.
 * Uses similar process as step 2 with moderator.
 * The moderator decides which portions to strike, perhaps all.
 * Some joint statement is made publicly.
 * If a joint statement cannot be agreed upon, the moderator makes one.

# Extra A. Incentives, Dismissal, Releases

 * Either party can incentivize for the other party to participate.
 * Incentives may include clawback clauses if the moderator determines appropriate.
 * Both parties (optionally?) agree to release the other from all known and unknown legal claims in exchange for agreeing to this process.

# Extra B. Truthfulness

 * If a false statement is made, punishable up to 2x the reward.
 * At any time, either party can create a platform for, or run, a bounty
   program for whistleblowers to testify about false statements made.
 * The moderator decides the rules needed to preserve privacy where appropriate.
 * Whistleblower statements will be reviewed by a system approved by the moderator to enforce penalties of this agreement.
 * Both parties have the right to publish moderator redacted portions of
   whistleblower material contributed to the aforementioned bounty program.
 * Both parties agree to indemnify such whistleblowers to the full extent

# Extra C. IP Rights

 * All contributed processes and information belong to their respective original owners.
