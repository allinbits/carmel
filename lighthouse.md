# Project Lighthouse

Project Lighthouse is conceptually linked to Project Carmel. They may appear as separate entities, but both projects can potentially share similar technical foundations. While Carmel is focused on debates, Lighthouse takes those principles and applies them to the management of a knowledge base. The underlying architecture can be similar, promoting synergies and allowing both projects to benefit from shared enhancements and updates.

Draft spec, please provide feedback in the form of pull requests and issues to github.com/allinbits/carmel.
